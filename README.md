# matrix.vim
I really liked this theme, but I wanted a little a little more color to it (specifically with compiler macros). So I modified and added some more colors. However, I also wanted it somewhere so I don't have to remake it every time I lose it or something.

I do not claim any rights to this, I just modified lines about macros, constants, and maybe a couple other ones, otherwise this is exactly the same as the other one, so I don't care what you do with this, the other guy's name is still on the file, so I feel that he's been credited. Look at him for reference to a license.

## Install
Just add it to `~/.vim/colors/` and then add `colorscheme matrix` to your `.vimrc` file. Basically, same as always.
